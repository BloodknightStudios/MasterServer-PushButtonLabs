# Flood Control Settings
# 
# Flood control uses a ticket based approach to deal with remote hosts
# that are either game clients continously querying us or malicious parties
# attempting cause an Denial of Service attack by keeping the master busy.
# 
# A remote host will be ticketed for every packet of data it sends to this
# master server, so keep that in mind when setting the maximum of tickets.
# There's even a setting to incor a severe penalty for sending bad/unknown
# packets to us of which helps ban the offending remote host a lot sooner.
# 
# Once maximum tickets has reached for a remote host they are then temporarily
# banned. When a remote host is banned they are ignored until the ban time has
# expired. A remote host is forgotten about after not receiving a packet from
# them after a time of seconds ($flood::ForgetTime), except when they are
# currently banned. Once unbanned then the forget time is reset so they are
# not forgotten too soon.
